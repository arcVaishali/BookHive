> #### Inspiration

> - One day, I handed over my old books, second-hand books, and used books to a scrap dealer. becoz they are not of my use . I had an idea to create an app that enables people to exchange books and share knowledge. The app would notify person B about books person A has and their location so they can arrange a meeting and benefit from each other's books and wisdom.

## What it does
It simply links people to their useful books, which can be utilised by another person based on their location; there is a location window that allows them to know person location`s. The app is simple to use, with a login and sign up to get into the app and see new books every day and connect with new people who share their books , second hand books , old books via a swiper window.

## How we built it
The site was built with a React , Tailwind, Vite, Kinetone stack. We started by looking at some wireframes to get a basic idea of how to layout the pages we wanted. The pages were created as  components using react app router. We started building User interface and then used a combination of tailwind  For the backend, Kinetone was setup. Kinetone is a backend as a service tool which minimizes the hassle of creating a backend that can perform basic CRUD operations. We used the APIs provided by Kinetone for user authentications, user dashboard creation and books data collection. Finally, deploying to Vercel was logical and smooth considering that the hosting platform is wired up well for react projects.

## Challenges we ran into
We had difficulty engaging with folks; some joined and expressed enthusiasm in working, but then left on our journey to develop the programme.  Secondly  the majority of our members were unfamiliar with some of the technologies mentioned above, it took a long time to create the first skeleton of our project and get everyone on the same page. Furthermore, we struggled to implement OAuth into our project while also developing an acceptable design template and theme. But ultimately, we came up with the final application.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of our major achievements is that we were able to effectively plan, work strategically in such a less time and present you all with our basic barebone of this idea- Book Hive time zones Were same for us as we were inly two of them ; we were able to effectively deliver the MVP of our idea. In addition to this we are proud of making something useful and impactful for our society. Moreover our novice team members acquired experience with working new technologies like React js to which they were widely unfamiliar. 
## What we learned
Building a business/app/website/idea from scratch in a weekend is both time-consuming and enjoyable. It is amazing what can be accomplished when everyone on the team is clear on the goals and focusing on their individual skills. The major takeaway from this is to begin with basic resources and grow from there. Frameworks and such are useful for constructing quickly, but in order for everyone to participate.

## What's next for BookHive
- a functioning backend
- notifications to user regarding books 
- liked  , disliked , rating mechanism 
- could have the reel format for book swiper mechanism for perfect user experience
